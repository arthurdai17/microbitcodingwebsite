          <h3>Why this idea?</h3>
          <p>This project focuses on <strong>THREE</strong> key aspects:
            <ul>
              <li>Target audience: 11 - 12 year olds students (which are between Year 7 and Year 8, just started secondary school)</li>
              <li>Education purpose</li>
              <li>Fun, playful and creative</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on my research, I discovered that 11-12 year olds are naturally curious, independent, and love exploring new things. They are often drawn to video games and technology, finding them fun and engaging. 
            Taking inspiration from my own experiences during that age, where I enjoyed playing computer games and having a good time, I decided to build a simple and playful micro:bit game. 
            By tapping into their interests and my own fond memories, I aim to create an exciting and enjoyable experience that sparks their curiosity and encourages their creativity.

        <div id="reasons-format">
          <h3>Why this format?</h3>
          <p>
            I chose a webpage to present my project to 11-12 year olds instead of using videos or PowerPoint for two main reasons. Firstly, a webpage allows them to access project materials and resources from anywhere and at any time. 
            They can easily view everything on their computer, tablet, or even their smartphone. It's convenient and flexible.
            Secondly, it provides a fully documented and detailed presentation, offering comprehensive explanations and instructions. 
            This way, students can explore the content at their own pace and have all the information they need to engage with the project effectively.
