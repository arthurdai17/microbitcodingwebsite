          <h1>Catch The Light (Game)</h1>

          <p>
            Before we delve into the workings of the "Catch The Light with
            Buttons" game and the process of building this project, if you'd
            like to familiarize yourself with the micro:bit board, you can start
            by learning the basics from the following link
            <a
              href="https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/introduction/"
              title="Micro:bit Tutorial"

              src="images/microbit-crossline.png"

          <p>
            In this game, players are presented with a 5x5 grid consisting of 25
            LED lights representing different coordinates on the micro:bit
            board. The game begins with a countdown from 3 to 1, and players use
            Button A, Button B, and Button AB (press and hold both buttons A and
            B at the same time) as controllers. Button A controls the first two
            columns of the grid, excluding coordinates [2, 0] and [2, 1], while
            Button AB controls the middle column and the middle row. Button B,
            on the other hand, controls the last two columns, excluding
            coordinates [2, 3] and [2, 4]. Each round, only one LED light
            appears on the grid at a time. Players earn one point and advance to
            the next round by correctly pressing the corresponding button for
            the lit LED. However, pressing the wrong button results in immediate
            game over, with no points earned. After the game concludes, the
            final score and time spent playing are displayed.

          <p>
            In the context of the micro:bit board, coordinates refer to the
            specific positions or locations on the LED grid of the micro:bit.
            The micro:bit features a 5x5 grid of LEDs, resulting in a total of
            25 individual LED lights. Each LED represents a coordinate within
            the grid. The coordinates on the micro:bit LED grid are represented
            by two numbers: an x-coordinate (horizontal) and a y-coordinate
            (vertical). The x-coordinate ranges from 0 to 4, representing the
            columns from left to right. The y-coordinate also ranges from 0 to
            4, representing the rows from top to bottom. For example, the
            coordinate (0, 0) represents the top-left corner of the LED grid,
            and (4, 4) represents the bottom-right corner. By specifying the
            appropriate x and y coordinates, you can control and manipulate
            individual LEDs or groups of LEDs on the micro:bit board.
