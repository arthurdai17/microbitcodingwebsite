            In this game, players are presented with a 5x5 grid consisting of 25
            LED lights representing different coordinates on the micro:bit
            board. The game begins with a countdown from 3 to 1, and players use
            Button A, Button B, and Button AB (press and hold both buttons A and
            B at the same time) as controllers. Button A controls the first two
            columns of the grid, excluding coordinates [2, 0] and [2, 1], while
            Button AB controls the middle column and the middle row. Button B,
            on the other hand, controls the last two columns, excluding
            coordinates [2, 3] and [2, 4]. Each round, only one LED light
            appears randomly on the grid at a time. Players earn one point and
            advance to the next round by correctly pressing the corresponding
            button for the lit LED. However, pressing the wrong button results
            in immediate game over, with no points earned. After the game
            concludes, the final score and time spent playing are displayed.

          <p>
            In the context of the micro:bit board, coordinates refer to the
            specific positions or locations on the LED grid of the micro:bit.
            The micro:bit features a 5x5 grid of LEDs, resulting in a total of
            25 individual LED lights. Each LED represents a coordinate within
            the grid. The coordinates on the micro:bit LED grid are represented
            by two numbers: an x-coordinate (horizontal) and a y-coordinate
            (vertical). The x-coordinate ranges from 0 to 4, representing the
            columns from left to right. The y-coordinate also ranges from 0 to
            4, representing the rows from top to bottom. For example, the
            coordinate (0, 0) represents the top-left corner of the LED grid,
            and (4, 4) represents the bottom-right corner. By specifying the
            appropriate x and y coordinates, you can control and manipulate
            individual LEDs or groups of LEDs on the micro:bit board.

                <p>
                  In Step 1, we need to figure out how to randomly light up just
                  one LED at a time on the grid for each round. Since we know
                  that each LED represents a coordinate in the grid, we can
                  think of it as having an x-coordinate (horizontal) and a
                  y-coordinate (vertical). The x-coordinate represents the
                  column number, while the y-coordinate represents the row
                  number.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, how do we make it random? It's simple! We can use the
                  magic of math by employing the trusty Math.randomRange()
                  function. For example: Math.randomRange(0, 4), now we can get
                  a random number between 0 and 4 for both the x and y
                  coordinates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we have these random coordinates, we can create a nifty
                  little function that takes them as inputs and lights up the
                  corresponding LED on the grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, every time we call this function, a random LED will light
                  up on the grid, adding that extra element of surprise and
                  variability to the game.

                <p>
                  In Step 2, let's talk about the variable called 'isRoundOver'.
                  This variable is very important because it helps us figure out
                  if the current round is over or not. Basically, it holds a
                  boolean value, which means it can be either true or false.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the beginning of each round, we set 'isRoundOver' to false.
                  This means the round is still in progress, and the players
                  haven't lost yet. If the players successfully complete the
                  round, we keep 'isRoundOver' as false because the round is
                  still ongoing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But here's the twist: if the players lose the round, we set
                  'isRoundOver' to true. This tells us that the round is over
                  and they didn't make it. However, after the game ends, we
                  reset 'isRoundOver' back to false. Why? Well, that's because
                  we want to start a new game right away without any delay.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the help of the 'isRoundOver' variable, we can easily
                  keep track of the round's status and make sure everything runs
                  smoothly.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In Step 3, let's talk about how we keep track of the score in
                  this game. The rule is straightforward: if the players win a
                  round, they earn one point. It's one point per round, simple
                  as that!
                </p>
                <p>
                  To implement this, we start by declaring a variable called
                  'score' at the beginning of the game and initialize it to 0.
                  This variable will hold the player's score throughout the
                  game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whenever the player wins a round, we increase their score by
                  one. How do we do it? Well, there are a couple of ways. We can
                  use the expression 'score = score + 1', which adds one to the
                  current score. Alternatively, we can use the shorthand form
                  'score += 1', which does the same thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, if the player loses a round, no points are
                  awarded, and they lose the game right away. So, it's important
                  for them to aim for victory in each round to boost their
                  score.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By keeping track of the score, we can add an element of
                  competition and motivate the players to strive for success in
                  the game.

                <p>
                  In Step 4, let's dive into tracking the time spent by the
                  player while playing the game. Before we use our game as an
                  example, let's understand the concept of an in-built function
                  called 'input.runningTime()'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This function gives us the number of milliseconds that have
                  passed since the micro:bit was powered on or restarted. It
                  allows us to measure time during the execution of our code.
                  For instance, by recording the current time before and after a
                  specific operation or event, we can calculate the time
                  difference using 'input.runningTime()'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, let's apply this concept to our game example. Firstly, we
                  declare a variable called 'startTime' and set it to 0. Keep in
                  mind that our game begins with a 3-second countdown. After
                  that, we capture the time that has already passed before the
                  game starts using 'startTime = input.runningTime()'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During the game, if the player loses, we immediately declare
                  another variable called 'elapsedTime' to calculate the time
                  difference. Using the formula 'elapsedTime =
                  input.runningTime() - startTime', we obtain the current total
                  time spent on the micro:bit, subtracting the time spent before
                  the game started. This provides us with the actual game time
                  that the player has spent from the start to the end of the
                  game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is how we determine the time the player has spent playing
                  the game. Additionally, we display the score through LEDs once
                  the game has finished, giving the player a visual
                  representation of their performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By incorporating time tracking into our game, we can provide
                  an engaging and time-bound challenge for the players,
                  enhancing the overall experience.

                  In Step 5, let's dive into the code and focus on how the
                  player can win a round. As we already know, winning a round
                  requires the player to press the corresponding button for the
                  lit LED. Each button has control over specific columns and
                  rows on the grid: Button A controls the first two columns
                  (excluding coordinates [2, 0] and [2, 1]), Button AB controls
                  the middle column and middle row, and Button B controls the
                  last two columns (excluding coordinates [2, 3] and [2, 4]).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To check the state of the LED light, we need to understand a
                  few functions: 'led.point' and 'led.plot'. The 'led.point'
                  function determines the state of the LED, whether it's 'on' or
                  'off', without actually lighting it up. It returns a boolean
                  value indicating the LED's state. On the other hand, the
                  'led.plot' function is responsible for lighting up the LED on
                  the grid and can also change its state from 'on' to 'off' or
                  vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since the game involves the player pressing the correct button
                  to win the round, we need to check if the light at a specific
                  coordinate is 'on' or 'off'. This check helps us determine if
                  the player clicked the correct button. The figure on the right
                  illustrates the check condition function, which returns true
                  if the light is 'on' and false if it's 'off'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the figure on the left, we see that if the player presses
                  the correct button, we add one point to the score. Since the
                  round is not over yet, we set the 'isRoundOver' variable to
                  false. Finally, we move on to the next round and continue the
                  game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But what happens if the player loses the game? Don't worry,
                  we'll address this in the following steps. You're making great
                  progress! Keep it up!

                <p>
                  In Step 6, let's explore what happens when the player loses
                  the game. As depicted in the figure above, we immediately
                  declare and initialize the 'elapsedTime' variable to keep
                  track of the time the player spent playing the game. Then, we
                  set the 'isRoundOver' variable to true, indicating that the
                  round is over because the player lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To provide a sense of closure, we display the final score
                  using the 'basic.showString()' and 'basic.showNumber()'
                  functions. Afterward, we divide the 'elapsedTime' by 1000
                  because the micro:bit board measures time in milliseconds, but
                  we want to present it in seconds. To achieve this, we convert
                  the total game time, represented as a number, into a String
                  using the 'toString()' function. Subsequently, we display the
                  total game time to the player and restart the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Displaying the final score and game time adds a competitive
                  element to the game, motivating players to strive for the
                  highest score and complete the game in the shortest time
                  possible. This fosters engagement and encourages players to
                  continue playing and improving their performance.

                <p>
                  In Step 7, it's crucial to remember to reset everything after
                  the player loses the game. Failure to do so would prevent us
                  from continuing to play and could lead to using the score and
                  game time from the previous game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To ensure a fresh start, it's important to reset all variables
                  and related elements. This includes using the
                  'basic.clearScreen()' function to clear the LED matrix,
                  resetting the 'score' and 'startTime' variables back to 0, and
                  setting 'isRoundOver' to false. By resetting everything, we
                  can prepare the game for a new session.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By following this practice and resetting everything before
                  starting a new game, we maintain a clean slate and avoid any
                  interference or carryover from previous game sessions. This
                  allows for a fair and consistent gameplay experience.

                </div>
                <p>
                  In Step 8, let's focus on creating a countdown animation for
                  the game. The game begins with a countdown from 3 to 1, which
                  enhances the user experience and adds interactivity to the
                  game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To achieve this, we can create a function that includes a for
                  loop. Within the loop, we display the countdown numbers and
                  introduce a delay of 0.5 seconds using the 'basic.pause()'
                  function. As illustrated in the figure above, the pause
                  duration is set to 500 milliseconds, equivalent to 0.5
                  seconds. This allows for a brief pause before moving on to the
                  next iteration. By utilizing a for loop, we can iterate
                  through the process three times, making the code more
                  efficient and executing the countdown animation faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To incorporate the countdown animation, we call this function
                  before the game starts, setting the stage for an engaging and
                  dynamic game experience.

                    alt="ShowFlashCrossLineAnimation"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  In Step 9, let's introduce more animation to our game. This
                  animation involves a flashing crossline made up of LED lights,
                  which appears after the countdown at the start of the game and
                  before the actual gameplay begins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To achieve this, we utilize the 'basic.showLeds()' function,
                  which allows us to draw custom shapes on the LED matrix. In
                  this case, we draw a crossline to highlight the middle column
                  and middle row of the game. The crossline is created using a
                  combination of dots (representing the LED lights turned off)
                  and hashtags (representing the LED lights turned on). It's
                  important to ensure that the drawing is done on a 5x5 grid, as
                  deviating from this grid size may cause issues with the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As depicted in the figure above, the first drawing is left
                  empty, the second drawing represents the crossline, and the
                  final drawing is empty again. The reason for having an empty
                  drawing at the end is to clear the LED matrix before the game
                  starts. Otherwise, the crossline would remain on the screen
                  indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Furthermore, it's crucial to understand the order of function
                  declarations and function calls. After declaring a function,
                  it's necessary to call the function for it to work properly.
                  The figure below demonstrates the sequence of three function
                  calls, and it's important to follow this order correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By adding this animation and adhering to the correct order of
                  function calls, we enhance the visual appeal of the game and
                  ensure the smooth execution of each animation sequence.
